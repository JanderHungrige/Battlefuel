# 36 — Advisor UI — Recommendations with Rationale & Apply

## Purpose

The operator-facing engine: an **Advisor panel** that requests advice (reposition, refuel plan,
redistribution, and — when a unit + destination are selected — route ranking), shows each
recommendation's **rationale** and score, and offers **"apply"** to turn an applyable
recommendation into a real move / refuel / buy order.

## Architecture

```
api/types.ts + client.ts   AdviceResult/Recommendation types + getReposition/getRefuelPlan/
                           getRedistribution/getRouteAdvice
hooks/useAdvisor.ts        open/toggle, request(kind)→result, apply(rec)→existing order client,
                           busy/error; pushes a chatter line and refetches supply on apply
components/AdvisorPanel.tsx  request buttons + recommendation list (rationale, score, Apply)
roles.ts                   add 'advisor' PanelKey to both roles
App.tsx                    topbar "Advisor" toggle + mount, gated by canShow(role,'advisor')
```

## Data Model

Frontend mirrors of the backend advice domain: `RecommendationKind`, `Recommendation`
(`kind`, `target`, `action: Record<string, unknown>`, `score`, `rationale`), `AdviceResult`.

## API Endpoints

Consumes (no new endpoints): `GET /advice/reposition`, `/advice/refuel-plan`,
`/advice/redistribution`, `/advice/route`.

## Business Rules

- Buttons request each advice kind on demand; **route** is enabled only when a unit is selected
  and a destination is picked (reuses the move-planning selection).
- Each recommendation row shows its `rationale` and `score`. An **Apply** button appears only when
  `action.endpoint` is present (transfer moves from redistribution are display-only).
- **Apply** dispatches by `action.endpoint`: `move-orders` → create+confirm move order;
  `refuel-orders` → create+confirm refuel order; `buy-orders` → create+confirm buy order. On
  success a chatter line is logged and the supply overview refetched.
- The panel mounts in both roles via `canShow(role, 'advisor')`.
- **Map marking (enhancement):** clicking a recommendation row selects it and marks it on the
  map — a highlighted cell plus a **yellow NATO-style movement-axis arrow** (shaft + arrowhead,
  `adviceArrowToGeoJSON`) derived per kind by `useAdviceMarker`: route/reposition =
  unit→destination, **refuel = truck→unit** (the refuel action carries `truck_id`), **transfer =
  from-depot→to-depot**. Buy recs (no movement) highlight the depot only. milsymbol covers unit
  icons, not tactical mission graphics, so the arrow is a custom axis-of-advance approximation.

## Data Flow

Advice endpoints → `useAdvisor.result` → `AdvisorPanel` rows. Apply → existing Wave-3/5 client
methods → server-authoritative orders; chatter + supply refresh close the loop.

## Dependencies

33/34/35 (advice endpoints), 28 (role gating), 09 (app shell); apply reuses move (13), refuel
(26), buy (27) client methods.

## Security

Read + instruct over open MVP endpoints; apply re-validates server-side. No secrets.
