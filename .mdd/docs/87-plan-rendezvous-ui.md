# 87 — Plan Rendezvous UI

## Purpose

The OF-8 frontend flow for a rendezvous fuel run. On a selected fuel truck the operator clicks
**Plan rendezvous** (alongside **Create fuel run**), then picks the **unit** (map click) and the
**meeting sector** (map click). The panel previews **both** movers' Safe/Fast routes on the map and
shows each one's **fuel-to-meet**. The operator then either **Order now** (immediate dispatch, F1)
or **Plan rendezvous** → a sim-time delay → **Send order** (files it as planned, F2).

## Architecture

Mirrors the Wave-12 `useFuelRun` + `FuelRunPanel` + map-preview pattern:

- **`usePlanRendezvous` hook** — state machine `idle → pick-unit → pick-sector → review`. Holds
  truck/unit ids, the sector, `truck_routes` + `unit_routes` (from `/rendezvous/plan`), and the
  selected metric. Actions: `start(truckId,name)`, `pickUnit(unitId)`, `pickSector(lat,lon)`,
  `selectMetric`, `orderNow()`, `schedule(scheduledGameS)`, `cancel()`.
- **`PlanRendezvousPanel`** — renders the truck→unit→sector summary, a Safe/Fast toggle, both
  movers' route metrics + fuel-to-meet for the chosen metric, an **Order now** button, and a
  **Plan rendezvous** toggle revealing hours/minutes delay inputs + **Send order**.
- **Map preview** — a new `rendezvous-routes` source/layer (amber) drawing both movers' selected
  metric routes bold + the alternatives faint (mirrors `fuel-run-routes`). Two new pick modes:
  `rendezvousPickUnit` (unit click → `onPickRendezvousUnit`) and `rendezvousPickSector` (any map
  click → `onPickRendezvousSector`).
- **API client** — `planRendezvous`, `createRendezvous`, `scheduleRendezvous` (+ shared TS types
  matching the F1/F2 response shapes). Esc cancels the flow (reuses the existing Esc → `clear`).

## Data Flow

Greenfield UI over F1/F2 endpoints. `RouteOption.fuel_consumed_l` (per mover, per metric) is the
fuel-to-meet; `RendezvousPlanResponse.sector` is the snapped H3 cell centre both movers route to.

## Business Rules

- Plan-rendezvous is OF-8 only (gated by `canShow(role, 'supplyPanel')`, like fuel runs).
- The schedule delay maps to `scheduled_game_s` (`hours*3600 + minutes*60`); 0 is rejected by the
  panel (use Order now instead).
- Order-now and schedule both send the snapped sector; the backend re-plans authoritatively.

## Dependencies

- **85-rendezvous-routing** — `/rendezvous/plan` (dual routes + fuel-to-meet) + `/rendezvous` (order now).
- **86-scheduled-rendezvous-orders** — `/rendezvous/schedule` (file as planned).
- **74-routed-fuel-run** — the `useFuelRun`/`FuelRunPanel`/map-preview patterns this mirrors.

## Security

Frontend only; no secrets. The server re-plans on order/launch, so client-sent geometry is never
trusted.

## Known Issues

- Sim-clock date/time requested; implemented as a relative sim-time delay (see frontmatter).
